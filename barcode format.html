<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Coupons in North America are typically printed with a barcode.
This barcode contains information about the value of the coupon, rules for how the can be redeemed and other information.
The barcode can be scanned with a barcode scanner which results in a numeric string.
</p>
<p>In order to understand what is encoded in the barcode string, you must decode the string.
This can be accomplished by using one of the coupon barcode decoders available on the web, but for a automated approach you need a program
which can decode the string and provide the needed information.
The <b>coupon-barcde</b> project is a Javascript project which performs this decoding task.</p>
<p>This information was learned by trial and error from the <a href="https://www.databar-barcode.info/coupon-decoder/">GS1 Databar info web page</a>.

<h1>Coupon Barcode String Format</h1>
<p>The North American coupon barcode string format standard is defined by the GS1 Databar effort.
The GS1 Databar format was formally adopted by the global supply chain in January 2011.</p>

<p>The overall format of the barcode string breaks down into two sections, a required fields section followed by a series of zero to seven optional field sections.
The length of the required fields section is between 25 and 39 characters.</p>

<p>The barcode begins with a 4 character <i>Application Identifier</i>, which for North American coupons is <b>8110</b>.
This is followed by other fields which are detailed in the table below.</p>

<h1>Field Formats</h1>
<p>The defined fields in the barcode string are of two primary types, fixed and variable length.
The fixed fields are always a fixed length and can be interpreted by simply reading the field length number of characaters from the string.
The variable length fields vary not only in their length but also in how their length value is interpreted and are discussed in the following topic.</p>

<h2>Variable-length field format</h2>
<p>Whenever a field is defined as <b>Variable</b> length, the format of the field is a length-prefixed string.
The first character of the string is a character representation of an integer
which determines the length of the remainder of the field in characters.</p>

<p>There are two types of variable-length fields used, which this document will refer to as <i>Variable+0</i> and <i>Variable+6</i>:
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Variable+0</b></dt>
      <dd>the length character is an integer representing the length of the remainder of the field.
        Experimentation has shown that the length value is always [1-5].</dd>
    <dt><b>Variable+6</b></dt>
      <dd>the length character is an integer which should be added to six to determine
        the length of the remainder of the field. The set of valid values for the length varies by usage;
        in most cases the values are [0-6] (resulting in a field length of 6 to 12 characters),
        but some fields accept [0-7], [0-9] and even [0-69] {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
        where [0-6] has the typical meaning but '9' has a special meaning.</dd>
  </dl>

<p>For example, if a <b>Variable+6</b> field begins with <b>153017533180515</b>, the variable portion of the field is seven characters long 
This string should be interpreted as:</p>
<pre>
1 - length of field, which should be added to 6, giving a field length of 7
5301753 - value of the field (the next 7 characters)
3180515 - additional fields to be parsed
</pre>

<p>Alternately, if the same string was defined as beginning with a <b>Variable+0</b> field, the following would be the result of parsing:</p>
<pre>
1 - length of field (plus 0)
5 - value of the field
3017533180515 - additional fields to be parsed
</pre>
