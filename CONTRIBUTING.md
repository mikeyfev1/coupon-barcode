Introduction

First of all, thank you for considering contribution to coupon-barcode.

This is my first open source contribution and I am still learning the environment, so please bear with me while I
figure everything out. As you will see, I need help with: 1) getting these files built-up as a NPM installable package
and advice about the fact that I do all of my parsing in an object constructor (is this bad?)

Feel free to mention anything that would help to me at mailto://mike@theFrederickHome.name
