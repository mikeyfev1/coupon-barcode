Introduction

First of all, thank you for considering contribution to coupon-barcode.

This is my first open source contribution and I am still learning the environment, so please bear with me while I
figure everything out. To simplify things, I will not be accepting contributions until I understand and can utilize
the environment.

My goal is to convert my working file set to an NPM-installable project.

Feel free to mention anything you find interesting to me at mailto://mike@theFrederickHome.name
